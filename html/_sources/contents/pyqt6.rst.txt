PyQt6 Installation
==================

All the examples given in this tutorial are based on **PyQt6** graphical objects.

**PyQt6** is the Python version of the famous `Qt Framework <https://www.qt.io/product/framework>`_, that contains a comprehensive set of highly intuitive and modularized C++ library classes (contained in APIs to simplify application development). 

**Qt** produces highly readable, easily maintainable and reusable code with high runtime performance and small footprint â€“ and it's cross-platform.

PyQt : the Python API
---------------------

**PyQt6** is a comprehensive set of Python bindings for Qt v6. It is implemented as more than 35 extension modules and enables Python to be used as an alternative application development language to C++ on all supported platforms including iOS and Android.

A complete documentation of this API can be found on the `PyQt6 project website <https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/>`_. Here is the direct link to `PyQt6 documentation <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt6/>`_.

PyQt6 Installation

The GPL version of PyQt6 can be installed from PyPI:

.. caution::
   In the **Anaconda distribution**, only the **PyQt5** version is included in the *conda packages*. But you can install **PyQt6** by using the previous pip command in an *Anaconda prompt*.
